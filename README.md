# CryptoTax
Small python application to Coalate Crypto payments and historical rates for tax reporting. 
Written with small time Etherium miners in mind, this application can pull payments to a Miner's Wallet address and even filter by pool address. 
It can then pull historical rates for etherium on the Day, Month, or Year of the payout and will generate a CSV file for further processing in Excel or Sheets. 

## How to use. 
This is a command line script and you will need python 3.9 to run it. Start by making your configuration.json file.
